# globby shorty

this is a very simple rust bin that monitors global keypresses and can respond to specific
shortcuts with whatever.

currently, it's a basic hard-coded set of app launches, since that's actually what
i want it to do, but it's easy to tweak to do whatever.

at some point i may genericise this to use a config file, but cba rn
